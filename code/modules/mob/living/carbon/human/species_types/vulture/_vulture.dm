	desc = "Medicators originate from the the fetid swamps and murk within the Isle of Enigma. Their species has historically been localized around the area, \
	although the Brass Cataclysm of Heartfelt's fall has resulted in droves of their kind seeking refuge elsewhere. They are a newer form of sentience, with records dating back only after Zizo's ascension. \
	\n\n\
	Their appearance is gaunt, patches of bare skin riddled with feathers and pox scars, Medicators are a horrifying fusion of bird and men- unlike their far more appealing adversaries, the harpies. \
	With long, hanging beaks clacking as they breathe, other species find them dipleasing at best and repulsive at worst. Despite this, their eyes betray great intelligence behind otherwise monstrosity.	\
	\n\n\
	Born of carcinogens, pollution, mechanical and biological waste, these creatures were not always sentient. \
	Through their appearance, accidental origin, and innate sicknesses, they have gained the fascination and uplifting of Pestra and inherited aspects of the serpentine goddess in turn. \
	Medicators, as they called themselves, carry with them the bedside manners, or lack thereof, of the worst Pestrans. \
	Their culture holds discovery and medicinal breakthroughs in the highest regard, be it through experimentation to shift their own ailments or others'. \
	Medicators care little about the nickname granted to them by other species, 'feculents,' so long as their medical prowess is not subject to question. \
	\n\n\
	Medicators and Harpies often find themselves in conflict, mirroring the quarrels of their patrons, whether of conscious faith or not."
