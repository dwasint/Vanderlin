	\n\n\
	A dwarvened orc was an uncommon sight, until the second Goblin War caused an influx of them, as those dwarves captured by orcish forces were fed flesh of their fallen brothers. \
	Used mostly as cannon-fodder, as they were reluctant to fight their homeland. Some managed to escape captivity, yet they were rarely recognised and in turn shunned and treated like spies. \
	Outside of their size there is not much diffrence between a proper half-orc and dwarvened variant. Both posses unnatural strength, live mostly and isolation and are prone to violence. \
